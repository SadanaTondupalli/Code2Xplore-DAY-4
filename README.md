# Smart List Filter & Rebuilder – Day 4 Challenge

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Code2Xplore – 60 Days Challenge. The program processes a mixed list containing numbers and strings using basic Python concepts such as for loops and conditional statements.

## Objective
- Separate numbers and strings into two lists
- Ignore empty strings
- Count total numbers and strings
- Apply personalized logic to modify the final output

## Personalization Applied
I used Option B – Name Length Logic.
My name is Sadana and its length is 6 (even).
Since the length is even, I removed the first element from both lists after separation.

## Sample Input
data = [10, "Python", "", 25, "Loop", 40]

## Sample Output
Numbers List: [25, 40]
Strings List: ['Loop']

Total Numbers: 3
Total Strings: 2
